Create a web app (desktop or mobile) that provides a query box and a search button and then calls the Places Library for Google Maps . Format the results to give a good user experience.

This web app allows user to search places of their interest and provides quick results for their search query. 
There are three main web pages in this application. 
1) index.html
2) directions.html
3) hotels.html

Index.html allows user to search a particular location by providing either address, establishment name (such as a name of a stadium, etc.) and by providing geocodes. User are provided quick results for their search query.

directions.html provides direction for user from location A to location B. User can select different mode of transport to reach the destination such as walking, Transit or Driving. User will have to update either one of the location addresses (Location A or Location B) each time there is change in mode of transport.

If a user is looking to visit a particular city, they might be looking for a hotel to stay in the city. hotels.html gives a list of hotels in the city user is interested in visting. Helpful information such as contact number, address etc is provided to user for each hotel.
